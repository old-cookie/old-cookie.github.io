### Proposal

#### Introduction

##### Purpose

This proposal recommends measures to the management of Misaki to boost the sales of the shops in the shopping centre.

##### Background

Misaki is a new shopping centre located in Kwun Tong with its grand opening held last October. The centre aims to cater to all budgets and all shopping styles.

Since January 2019, it was noted that there has been a fall in the number of shoppers
which led to a drop in sales. Thus, in February 2019, the Marketing Department
conducted a customer satisfaction survey with 300 shoppers in the shopping centre.
The survey results indicated that the shoppers in general felt that the environment and services were good. However, about 30 percent of the customers were not very satisfied with their shopping experience. A majority of them commented that offering big sales promotion or running special events would provide an experience that makes visiting the centre more attractive. The impact of the drop in sales is not just on the shops' business in the shopping centre. It also affects the competitiveness of the centre in the long term. In view of this, the management has requested measures which would address this issue that the shopping centre is facing.

##### Situation Identified

It is apparent that there is a need for Misaki to draw up plans which aim to address the drop in sales of the shops in the shopping centre. In order to translate this aim into a specific course of action, proposals for concrete initiatives have been made and investigated.

#### Initial Proposals

Three options were initially proposed for immediate investigation:

1. to set up pop -up stores;
2. to launch a Sales Month; and
3. to host an autograph event by K-pop stars .

#### Investigation Findings

1. Setting up pop-up stores

    Pop-up stores are temporary retail spaces that sell a variety of products such as food, drinks and handicrafts. From art and fashion to tech gadgets and food, pop-up stores are exciting and engaging to shoppers.
    Setting up pop-up stores would become a special attraction of the shopping centre. This would result in an increased number of shoppers. Besides, the shopping centre will make all the arrangements. However, there are concerns about finding spaces for the pop-up stores. Another concern is that the work involved may increase the workload for the staff.

2. Launching a Sales Month

3. Hosting an autograph event by K-pop stars

    Korean stars are very popular......

### Recommended Proposal

Following the Investigation conclusions, it is recommended that Misaki should be set up pop-up stores to boost the soles of the shopping centre. Among the three options, this one is the best in terms of popularity and feasibility.

#### 1. Implementation

To implement the recommended proposal, a budget of HK$200,000 will be expected for the set-up and hiring part-time staff. Besides, the pop-up stores should be set up in June 20XX.

To make the proposal more popular, it would be necessary to send emails to members of Misaki Club about the information of the pop-up stores. This could help promote the events.

To address the concern about the location it is advised that Misaki should use the open space near the shopping centre's entrance to set up the stores. That location provides a lot of space for the pop-up stores. Besides, customers can see the pop-up stores immediately when they come to the shopping centre.

To resolve the problem on the workload of the staff, it would be advisable to hire part-time staff in order to help assist with the set-up of the pop-up stores. This will reduce the workload of the staff.

#### 2. Elaboration on benefits

Setting up pop-up stores would bring benefits to both the shops and the shopping centre.
The details are as follows:

##### Increasing business opportunities

If Misaki sets up pop-up stores, the shops involved can sell different types of products such as handicrafts and tech gadgets. Since these products are very special and exciting, it will attract a large number of customers. Thus, it would create more business opportunities for all the shops in the shopping centre.

##### Reducing preparation work

Setting up pop-up stores will require preparation work. As all the arrangements for setting up the pop-up stores will be made by the shopping centre, the shops will not need any preparation and could benefit from the increase in the number of customers. The shops would certainly support this proposal.

##### Enhancing media coverage

By setting up pop-up stores, the shops can offer special or limited products. This would enable the customers to gain memorable shopping experiences. Thus, they would share pictures on social media. This will help the shopping centre to gain more media coverage.

#### Conclusion

Overall, among the three proposed ways of boosting the sales of the shops, the proposal of setting up pop-up stores is the best option. With all the above benefits in mind, it is hoped that the proposal would be accepted.
